# Problem Statement
In my college I have sometimes been sceptical of whether a piece of information that is circulating is legitimate or not. That is how the idea for this project came to my mind.
In many institutions, the authenticity and legitimacy of circulated information are critical to maintaining trust and ensuring effective decision-making. However, unauthorized information dissemination, miscommunication, and the spread of false or misleading data can undermine these efforts. Current methods for verifying the origin and authenticity of information often rely on manual processes or centralized systems, which are prone to human error, manipulation, and inefficiencies.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing a blockchain-based solution that ensures only information generated by authorized staff members within the institution is considered legitimate. The immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain technology provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way to track and verify the origin of information. By leveraging smart contracts and decentralized identity management, the proposed system will automate the verification process, enhance data integrity, and build trust within the institution.

# LegitInfoChain
Creating a blockchain project to track and verify the legitimacy of information circulated within an institution.
The idea is to use blockchain's immutable ledger to ensure that only information generated by authorized staff members is considered legitimate.

# Project Scope and Requirements
Objective: Ensure that only information generated by authorized staff is legitimate.
Users: Institution staff (who generate information), and other members (who verify information).
Permissions: Different roles for users, e.g., admin (institution head), staff (information generators), and verifier (any member who checks information).

# System Architecture
Smart Contracts: For storing and verifying information (Solidity smart contract).
User Authentication: Ensuring only authorized staff can generate information (Truffle or Hardhat for compiling and deploying the contract).
Frontend Interface: For users to interact with the system (using react).

The project is currently in its infancy, I am a newbie to this ocean of block chain but I am looking forward to develop this project as time and my skills progress.
